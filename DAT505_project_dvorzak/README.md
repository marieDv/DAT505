# Angèle
## purpose
Angèle is dedicated to an uprising belgian singer. Her unique style of music can be discovered 
through multiple Three.js models that bend and transform to the frequency of her voice. The mapping is constructed in a way 
that emphasizes the sound the female voice rate to underline her performance. The user has the possibility to choose between
two of her most popular songs, but other songs could be added quite easily later on. 

## setup
The website doesn't require any server interaction and can easily be opened through any localhost. 

## implementation progress


### postprocessing
The basic setup of this application contains two render layers which undergo a different manipulation in the postprocessing. 
Both layers are extended through a mixture of manipulations due to the VolumetricLightShader, the AdditiveBlendingShader and the AfterimageShader. This process happens in the addComposer function inside the main JavaScript file of the project.
